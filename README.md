# Project Overview
A dashboard was built to allow user to explore 2018 large domestic carriers and major airportsâ€™ flight performance through summarized analysis, interactive visualizations, and responsive form. The dashboard uses the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Summary information on the number of ontime, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is determined using this dataset of 2018 flight delays and cancellations.
